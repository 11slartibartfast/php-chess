A chess library for PHP.

### Install

Via composer:

    $ composer require programarivm/php-chess

### Play Chess

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game();

$isLegalMove = $game->play('w', 'e4');
```
The call to the `$game->play` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not a chess move can be run on the board.

### Play Chess With the AI

Pass the `Game::MODE_AI` parameter when instantiating a `$game`:

```php
$game = new Game(Game::MODE_AI);

$game->play('w', 'e4');
$game->play('b', $game->response());
$game->play('w', 'e5');
$game->play('b', $game->response());
```

The AIs are stored in the [`model`](https://github.com/programarivm/php-chess/tree/master/model) folder. The default is `a1.model`, if you want to play with a different AI pass it as a second parameter to the `Chess\Game` constructor:

```php
$game = new Game(Game::MODE_AI, 'a2.model');

$game->play('w', 'e4');
$game->play('b', $game->response());
$game->play('w', 'e5');
$game->play('b', $game->response());
```

Currently a few machine learning models are being built with the [Rubix ML](https://github.com/RubixML/ML) library at [programarivm/chess-data](https://github.com/programarivm/chess-data). The supervised learning process is all about using suitable heuristics such as king safety, pressure, material or connectivity, among others. But how can we measure the efficiency of a given chess heuristic? This is where plotting data on nice charts comes to the rescue! A live demo is available at [Heuristics Quest](https://programarivm.github.io/heuristics-quest/).
