## PGN Chess for PHP

![PGN Chess](/resources/chess-move.jpg?raw=true)

This is a simple, friendly, and powerful PGN (Portable Game Notation) library for running chess games from within PHP applications. It understands the rules of chess, and is capable of validating and playing PGN notated games.

PGN Chess comes to the rescue in the following scenarios:

- Develop APIs on the server side for validating chess games
- Create funny, random games for fun
- Analyze games of chess
- Validate games
- Build chess-related web apps
- Play chess moves

### 1. Install

Via composer:

    $ composer require programarivm/pgn-chess

### 2. Usage

Just instantiate a board, and play PGN moves converted into PHP objects:

```php
<?php
use PGNChess\Board;
use PGNChess\PGN\Converter;
use PGNChess\PGN\Symbol;

$board = new Board;

$board->play(Converter::toObject(Symbol::WHITE, 'e4');
```

The call to the `$board->play` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not a chess move can be run on the board. It is up to you to process the result accordingly.

### 3. Examples

This is the output obtained when running `game01.php`:

    $ php examples/game01.php
    w played d4
    b played d6
    w played c4
    b played g6
    w played Nc3
    b played Bg7
    w played e4
    b played e6
    w played Nf3
    b played Ne7
    w played Bd3
    b played O-O
    w played Qc2
    b played Nd7
    w played O-O-O
    Illegal move

In this particular example we're printing the output and exiting the game if an illegal chess move is found. But obviously you can take a different approach, for example go into a loop till the player runs a valid move.

Again, it is up to you how to process the moves accordingly -- ask the player to please try again, play a sound, exit the game or whatever thing you consider appropriate. The important thing is that PGN Chess understands chess rules, internally replicating the game being played on the board.

Let's look at another example, the output generated by `game02.php`:

    $ php examples/game02.php
